`;
  }

  private generateOkrGuide(): string {
    return `# OKR Management Best Practices

## What are OKRs?
Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) are a goal-setting framework that helps organizations align and track progress toward ambitious goals.

## OKR Structure
- **Objective**: What you want to achieve (qualitative, inspirational)
- **Key Results**: How you measure progress (quantitative, specific)

## Setting Effective OKRs

### Objectives Should Be:
- **Inspirational**: Motivate and energize the team
- **Qualitative**: Describe the desired outcome
- **Time-bound**: Have a clear deadline
- **Actionable**: Within the team's control

### Key Results Should Be:
- **Measurable**: Include specific metrics
- **Achievable**: Challenging but realistic
- **Relevant**: Directly support the objective
- **Time-bound**: Have clear deadlines

## OKR Hierarchy
1. **Company OKRs**: Organization-wide strategic objectives
2. **Department OKRs**: Aligned with company goals
3. **Team OKRs**: Support department objectives
4. **Individual OKRs**: Contribute to team success

## OKR Cycle Management

### Quarterly Planning
1. Review previous quarter's results
2. Set new objectives for the coming quarter
3. Define key results with specific metrics
4. Align with higher-level OKRs
5. Get approval from manager/stakeholders

### Monthly Check-ins
- Update progress on key results
- Identify blockers and challenges
- Adjust tactics if needed
- Communicate updates to stakeholders

### Quarterly Reviews
- Assess final results and achievement rates
- Analyze what worked and what didn't
- Document lessons learned
- Plan improvements for next cycle

## Using PerformAI for OKR Management

### Goal Creation
- Use the goal creation wizard
- Select from OKR templates
- Link to company/department objectives
- Set up automatic progress tracking

### Progress Tracking
- Update progress regularly (weekly recommended)
- Add context and comments to updates
- Use visual progress indicators
- Set up automated reminders

### AI-Powered Insights
- Get achievement probability predictions
- Receive suggestions for improvement
- Identify potential risks early
- Get recommendations for resource allocation

## Common OKR Mistakes to Avoid
1. **Setting too many OKRs**: Focus on 3-5 objectives max
2. **Making them too easy**: OKRs should be ambitious
3. **Lack of alignment**: Ensure connection to higher-level goals
4. **Infrequent updates**: Regular check-ins are essential
5. **Treating as performance reviews**: OKRs are for alignment, not evaluation

## OKR Scoring
- **0.7-1.0**: Excellent achievement
- **0.4-0.6**: Good progress with some shortfalls
- **0.0-0.3**: Significant challenges, needs attention

Remember: 70% achievement is considered successful for ambitious OKRs!

   - Run a test sync to verify functionality
   - Review synchronized data for accuracy
   - Activate the integration

## Specific Integration Guides

### Workday Integration
1. **Obtain API Credentials**
   - Contact your Workday administrator
   - Request API access for PerformAI
   - Obtain tenant URL, username, and password

2. **Configure in PerformAI**
   - Enter Workday tenant URL
   - Provide authentication credentials
   - Select data fields to synchronize

3. **Data Mapping**
   - Map Workday fields to PerformAI fields
   - Configure organizational hierarchy sync
   - Set up employee status synchronization

### Okta SSO Integration
1. **Create Okta Application**
   - Log into Okta Admin Console
   - Create new SAML 2.0 application
   - Configure SSO settings

2. **Configure PerformAI**
   - Enter Okta domain and application details
   - Upload SAML certificate
   - Configure attribute mappings

3. **Test SSO Flow**
   - Test login process
   - Verify user attributes are mapped correctly
   - Enable for all users

### Slack Integration
1. **Create Slack App**
   - Go to Slack API console
   - Create new application
   - Configure OAuth scopes and permissions

2. **Install in Workspace**
   - Install app in your Slack workspace
   - Authorize required permissions
   - Note the webhook URL

3. **Configure Notifications**
   - Set up notification channels
   - Configure event triggers
   - Test notification delivery

## Webhook Configuration

### Setting Up Webhooks
Webhooks allow external systems to receive real-time notifications about PerformAI events.

1. **Create Webhook Endpoint**
   - Provide endpoint URL (must be HTTPS)
   - Select events to trigger webhook
   - Configure authentication (optional)

2. **Security Configuration**
   - Set up webhook secret for signature verification
   - Configure retry settings
   - Set timeout values

3. **Test Webhook**
   - Send test payload to verify connectivity
   - Check signature verification
   - Monitor delivery success rates

### Webhook Events
Available webhook events include:
- Employee lifecycle events (created, updated, deactivated)
- Performance review events (created, submitted, completed)
- Goal/OKR events (created, updated, completed)
- Feedback events (submitted, received)

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Authentication Problems
- **Invalid Credentials**: Verify API keys and passwords
- **Expired Tokens**: Refresh OAuth tokens if needed
- **Permission Issues**: Ensure proper API permissions are granted

### Sync Issues
- **Data Conflicts**: Check for conflicting data between systems
- **Rate Limiting**: Verify API rate limits aren't exceeded
- **Network Issues**: Check firewall and network connectivity

### Webhook Failures
- **Endpoint Unreachable**: Verify webhook URL is accessible
- **SSL Certificate Issues**: Ensure valid SSL certificate
- **Signature Verification**: Check webhook secret configuration

## Best Practices

### Security
- Use strong, unique API credentials
- Regularly rotate authentication tokens
- Monitor integration access logs
- Implement proper network security

### Data Management
- Regularly review synchronized data for accuracy
- Set up data validation rules
- Monitor for duplicate or conflicting records
- Maintain data backup and recovery procedures

### Monitoring
- Set up integration health monitoring
- Configure alerts for sync failures
- Review integration logs regularly
- Monitor API usage and rate limits

### Maintenance
- Keep integration configurations documented
- Test integrations after system updates
- Plan for credential rotation and updates
- Have rollback procedures ready

## Getting Support
- Check integration logs for specific error messages
- Review API documentation for the external system
- Contact PerformAI support with integration issues
- Engage with external system support if needed
