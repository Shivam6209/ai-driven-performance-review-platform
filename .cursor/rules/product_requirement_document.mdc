  employee_id: string; // Strict namespace isolation
  content_type: 'feedback' | 'goal' | 'review' | 'project';
  embedding: number[]; // 1536-dimensional vector (OpenAI)
  metadata: {
    created_at: string;
    source_id: string;
    tags: string[];
    visibility: string;
    content_preview: string; // First 100 chars for debugging
  };
}

```typescript
class ReviewGenerator {
  async generatePeerReview(employeeId: string, revieweeId: string): Promise<ReviewContent> {
    // Step 1: Validate relationship
    const relationship = await this.validateWorkingRelationship(employeeId, revieweeId);
    if (!relationship.isValid) throw new ValidationError('No working relationship found');
    
    // Step 2: Retrieve relevant context (12 months)
    const context = await this.retrieveEmployeeContext(revieweeId, '12months');
    
    // Step 3: Real-time validation during generation
    const generatedContent = await this.generateWithValidation(context, {
      template: 'peer_review',
      confidence_threshold: 0.7,
      max_tokens: 500
    });
    
    // Step 4: Source verification
    if (!this.verifyAllClaims(generatedContent, context)) {
      return { content: '', confidence: 0, sources: [] };
    }
    
    return generatedContent;
  }
}
```
